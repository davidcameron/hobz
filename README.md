# Q/A App

Like Stack Overflow, but focuses on getting answers in real-time, for organizations. We'll show the latest question first, and optionally show questions / answers as they're being typed (Wave style). Questions and answers have a short character limit, but an additional explanation can be added. It should be setup so that questions are either answered in a few seconds, or take much longer (i.e. prioritize LIFO). Users can "bump" un-answered questions.

As you're typing your question, we'll surface other similar questions that have been answered. If the same answer applies to you, we'll add the content of your question. That way the more times a question is asked in different ways, the easier it will be to find the answer.

We'll notify you if a question contains keywords similar to questions you've answered. Anyone can tag a question with another user's name they think could answer it.
